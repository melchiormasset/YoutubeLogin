Hello, it is Melchior from France, hope you are doing good!

This script is an easy python script used for automating your login process on YouTube. It is using Selenium and ONLY working in Firefox for the moment(Another version for the others search engines is curentely in developping) and works on Windows and Linux(MacOS should be supported but I did not tested).


To use this program you need to install the modules following these instructions:
	- Launch your terminal.
	- Write: "pip install -r requirements.txt".
	- The used modules are installed!


Then, fill your creds(email and password) in the creds.py file. It is really easy.
To finish, in you terminal, execute the program by writing:"python3 login.py".
It should work perfectly.
If it bugs or doesn't work, put an Issue on the GitHub page.

Have a great time using it!
